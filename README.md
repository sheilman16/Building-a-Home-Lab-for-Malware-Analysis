# Building a Home Lab for Malware Analysis
Women in Cyber Security Conference, 2018  
https://www.wicys.org/

# Abstract
This workshop will provide a walk-through of how to set up an at-home malware analysis lab with emphasis on best practices for constraining malware to a controlled, isolated environment. We will cover the importance of managing and operating your own personal lab. Attendees will get an overview of popular free tools (Procmon, Process Explorer, Regshot, and more) and instruction on how to customize and maintain the environment after initial configuration. There will be opportunity for hands on experience with behavior monitoring tools and examples of the fundamental artifacts that shed light on malware functionality. All experience levels welcome!
Laptop with VirtualBox installed is required. A Windows 7/10 ISO or similar is recommended, though not required
